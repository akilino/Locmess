Locmess - Android Project

Project Assignment for Ubiquitous and Mobile Computing

Goal of the project was to develop a distributed mobile application that aims at providing a set of location-aware messaging functionalities to users in urban centers, this way mimicking the use of a traditional post-it note with some written text that can be glued on some wall. Whoever shows interest on the subject may read the post.

Screenshots of the Locmess application can be found at the "Screenshots.pdf" file
